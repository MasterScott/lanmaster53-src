### Why Consult with Me?

Offensive Security is topic that often brings organizations pause, but the concept is simple. You must know where the holes in your security infrastructure exist before you can close them. Finding these holes isn't easy, and requires a tremendous amount of skill and experience, which is difficult to find. Eventually, you may require the assistance of an outside resource. As a result, the process also involves a tremendous amount of trust, as the job may require access to the most sensitive areas of your infrastructure. You'll need a consultant with a proven track record of ethical behavior and technical prowess.

I've been consulting on various security fronts for almost a decade, and there's few things I enjoy more than putting that experience to work through helping others improve in the areas of Application and Information security. From government agencies, to fortune 500 companies, to small businesses, I've served clients of all shapes and sizes. With extensive experience in Application Security review, Penetration Testing, and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection, allow me to help you improve the quality of your product through the protection of your assets.

Due to employment restrictions, I am currently providing only the following consulting services.

### Recon-ng as a Service (RAAS)

#### What exactly is RAAS?

Recon-ng as a Service (RAAS) is a service designed to provide efficient and affordable Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) collection using the full power of the Recon-ng framework.

Recon-ng is free and open source software to anyone who chooses to use it. However, some of the functionality within Recon-ng requires paid subscriptions to third party services in order to function at full capacity. For a normal user, access to all of the necessary third party services to fully leverage Recon-ng could cost tens of thousands of dollar per year. This makes some of the most powerful features of Recon-ng inaccessible to small-to-medium sized organizations, freelance consultants, and boutique consulting firms.

RAAS is a simple, straightforward, and affordable way maximize OSINT collection for any engagement. An individual or company pays an hourly rate for time (3-5 hours for a typical engagement), and an access fee per domain to offset the cost of third party services. In return, the customer receives an archive containing the following items:

* Recon-ng workspace containing the results of the engagement
* Textual recording of the engagement (spool of output from the framework)
* Various screenshots and snippents containing high value information
* Document containing notes from the engagement and guidance for using the workspace 

Custom reporting is also available, but is billed at the same rate as OSINT collection activities.

#### Why not do it yourself?

Below is a capability comparison between what a typical Recon-ng user can do with the framework, and what is included in RAAS. 

| Feature | Freebie | RAAS | Avg. Cost |
|---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Free OSINT resources | X | X | $0 |
