(Updated on Friday, May 8, 2015.)

The reason I began blogging years ago was to keep notes on things I wanted for future reference while sharing it with others and making it mildly entertaining to read. I've not done much of that here recently, as I've been trying to do it with 140 characters and screen shots. While this has worked well in the short term, the problem with Twitter is that tweets don't last forever. After a few months a tweet can be hard to access, and I've found it becoming increasingly difficult to redirect people to some of my aging tweets. Therefore, I decided to move a few of my more useful tweets here for historical record. Specifically, several tweets related to Burp Suite Pro.
